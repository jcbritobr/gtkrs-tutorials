# Michael's GTK Rust Tutorial â€” 2021 Edition

> This is currently a work in progress

Several years ago, before I joined System76, I wrote a tutorial for GTK-rs that was based on my early experiences as I was learning Rust and GTK at the same time. Eventually, I took the tutorial down because it was severely out of date; and no longer representative of best practices, current APIs, or even the state of Rust itself.

To this day, I'm still receiving receiving emails from people who have found references to my tutorial and are wondering if I'm ever going to bring it back. So, given that I have gained additional years of experience with Rust and GTK at System76, and there is interest in a renewal of this tutorial, I am rebooting the project. If it can help at least one person establish a career in writing GTK applications, then it's worth the effort.

However, since I have a full time job, this will only be worked on in my free time. The editing may not be as extensive as my former tutorial, so I'll keep the explanations concise, and pack it with real code that you can work alongside.
