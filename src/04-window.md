# Creating a Window with a Button

## Using GLib as an async runtime

First, let's make ourselves a convenience function for blocking on a future:


```rust
use std::future::Future;

fn block_on<F>(future: F) -> F::Output where F: Future {
    glib::MainContext::default().block_on(future)
}
```

This will schedule our futures to execute on the main thread, alongside all of the futures scheduled by GTK itself. Using `glib::MainContext::get_thread_default()` will get an executor for the thread where you are calling this from. This can be useful if you're wanting to spawn a future on a background thread for running your background tasks. There is also an option of using `glib::ThreadPool`, which gives you a multi-threaded executor which defaults to the number of virtual CPU cores in the system, and by default parks threads that have been idle for more than 15 seconds.

## Creating the App struct

I typically have a single `App` struct where all application state and GTK widgets that are regularly interacted with are stored. We're going to start with a struct that contains a `gtk::Button` and a `u32` "clicked" variable.

```rust
use async_channel::Sender;

struct App {
    pub button: gtk::Button,
    pub clicked: u32,
}

impl App {
    pub fn new(tx: Sender<Event>) -> Self {}
}
```

When creating the application, we will take ownership of the `Sender` that we created earlier, and pass this into every `connect_signal()` method that is called on a widget. The `connect_signal()` methods will create a future on the main context that idles until the condition for that future has been emitted. A `gtk::Button`, for example, has a `connect_clicked()` method which will have its callbacks invoked when `clicked` is emitted â€” which happens on a click of the button.

Note that you may connect multiple callbacks onto the same signal. If you wish to remove one, you should be careful to store the `SignalHandlerId` that is returned from the `connect_signal()` method. Then call `widget.disconnect(id)` to remove the signal registered to that widget. If you only wish to temporarily block a signal, you can call `widget.block_signal(id)` and `widget.unblock_signal(id)` respectively.

## Creating widgets for our app

First, we will create the button that we will have the user click. The button will have a label which reads, "Click Me". The border will be set to 4 so that the button isn't hugging the edges of the container it is attached to. And then will program it to send an event when it is clicked.

```rust
let button = cascade! {
    gtk::Button::with_label("Click Me");
    ..set_border_width(4);
    ..connect_clicked(move |_| {
        let _ = block_on(tx.send(Event::Clicked));
    });
};
```

Note that since we are using an async channel, the sender has to be awaited when it is sending a value. We can use GLib's default executor to await our send.

Next is creating a container widget to hold our button. This container will also invoke `show_all()` to make the container visible, and all of the widgets inside the container.

```rust
let container = cascade! {
    gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, 0);
    ..add(&button);
    ..show_all();
};
```

## Creating the window

Next we we will create the `Toplevel` window for this application, and attach our container to the window. We will set a title, connect the event to be called when window is deleted, and also set the default icon for our application. The `Toplevel` window is the main window of your application. A window can only have one widget attached to it, which we will assign with the `add()` method. The `set_title()` method will set the title of your application. The `connect_delete_event` method is invoked whenever the window is destroyed, and we will program this to call `gtk::main_quit()` to stop the mainloop, thereby having `gtk::main()` return, which has our application quit.


```rust
let _window = cascade! {
    gtk::Window::new(gtk::WindowType::Toplevel);
    ..add(&container);
    ..set_title("First GTK App");
    ..connect_delete_event(move |_, _| {
        gtk::main_quit();
        gtk::Inhibit(false)
    });
    ..show_all();
};
```

One last thing that should be done for window managers is to set a default icon for the application:

```rust
gtk::Window::set_default_icon_name("icon-name-here");
```

Now we can finally return our `App` struct, which should look like so:


```rust
impl App {
    pub fn new(tx: Sender<Event>) -> Self {
        let button = cascade! {
            gtk::Button::with_label("Click Me");
            ..set_border_width(4);
            ..connect_clicked(move |_| {
                let _ = block_on(tx.send(Event::Clicked));
            });
        };

        let container = cascade! {
            gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, 0);
            ..add(&button);
            ..show_all();
        };

        let _window = cascade! {
            gtk::Window::new(gtk::WindowType::Toplevel);
            ..set_title("First GTK App");
            ..add(&container);
            ..connect_delete_event(move |_, _| {
                gtk::main_quit();
                gtk::Inhibit(false)
            });
            ..show_all();
        };

        gtk::Window::set_default_icon_name("icon-name-here");

        Self { button, clicked: 0 }
    }
}
```

## Responding to the clicked event

In the example below, you can see that we have passed ownership of the `App` into the event handler. The `clicked` property is incremented whenever we receive `Event::Clicked`. The button's label is updated to show how many times it has been clicked.

```rust
fn main() {
    glib::set_program_name("First GTK App".into());
    glib::set_application_name("First GTK App");

    // Initialize GTK before proceeding.
    if gtk::init().is_err() {
        eprintln!("failed to initialize GTK Application");
        process::exit(1);
    }

    // Attach `tx` to our widgets, and `rx` to our event handler
    let (tx, rx) = async_channel::unbounded();

    let mut app = App::new(tx);

    // Processes all application events received from signals
    let event_handler = async move {
        while let Ok(event) = rx.recv().await {
            match event {
                Event::Clicked => {
                    app.clicked += 1;
                    app.button.set_label(&format!("I have been clicked {} times", app.clicked));
                }
            }
        }
    };

    // GLib has an executor in the background that will
    // asynchronously handle our events on this thread
    glib::MainContext::default().spawn_local(event_handler);

    // Thread will block here until the application is quit
    gtk::main();
}
```

You may run the application with `cargo run` and try it out.
